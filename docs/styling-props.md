# Styling Props

`UIPadding`s, `UIStroke`s, `UIListLayout`s, `UIAspectRatio`s... Children-based styling is just too much boilerplate. In OnyxUI, all components support an extensive set of properties to avoid working with these objects.

To see a full list of supported properties, see the [`Base`](/) component.

## Use in custom components

To support styling props in your own components, make use of the [`CombineProps`](/) utility to pass props through automatically.
