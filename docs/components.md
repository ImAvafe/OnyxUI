# Components

You can see the [full list of components here](/api/base).

:::info What's a component?
  If you're unfamiliar with the concept of components, they're basically widgets you can reuse throughout your UI. This is much more efficient than, for example, rescripting a button each time you need one.

:::info Extending types
  Props are documented with the component's name included. When accessing a component's props in code, for example, ***use `Button.Props`, not `Button.ButtonProps`.***
