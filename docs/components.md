# Components

You can see the [full list of components here](/api/base).

:::info What are components?
  If you're unfamiliar with the concept of components, they're basically widgets you can reuse throughout your UI. This is much more efficient than, for example, rescripting a button each time you need one.
:::

:::info Where are the props?
  To see the full list of a component's props, view the source code of that component.
:::

:::info Extending types
  Props interfaces are documented with the component's name included. When accessing a component's props in code, ***use `Component.Props`, not `Component.ComponentProps`.***
